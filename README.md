# Description
 This includes all stages of a real-world data science workflow: data collection, preprocessing, model building, and most importantly, deploying the model using Flask or FastAPI. The goal is to not only create a machine learning model but also make it accessible to users through a web API or web app, simulating how data products function in industry.
The task begins with data collection, where a dataset is either sourced from a public platform (like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or an open API) or created manually. A good example is the Iris dataset, which contains measurements of flower species and is used for classification tasks.
The next step is data preprocessing, which involves cleaning and preparing the data for modeling. This typically includes:
Handling missing values
Encoding categorical features
Normalizing or standardizing numerical features
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
After preprocessing, a machine learning model is developed using algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machine. These models are trained using Scikit-learn or similar libraries and evaluated on testing data. Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the model.
The standout feature of this task is model deployment. Interns must expose their model as a REST API using either Flask or FastAPI, two popular Python web frameworks. This allows other applications or users to send input data to the API and receive predictions in response.
In Flask-based deployment:
The model is saved to disk using joblib or pickle.
An API is created with routes, typically /predict, which handles POST requests.
The model loads at startup, and when a request is made with input features (usually in JSON format), the server processes the request, uses the model to make a prediction, and returns the result.
The final deliverable is a functional API or web app. Interns are encouraged to test the API using tools like Postman or curl, or even create a simple web interface with HTML for user interaction.
By completing this task, interns learn how to bridge the gap between data science and software engineering. In real-world applications, deploying models so they can be used by websites, mobile apps, or internal tools is a critical skill. Without deployment, even the most accurate model has limited practical value.
